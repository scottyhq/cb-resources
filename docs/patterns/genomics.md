# Genomics research

The cloud brings to genomics teams the ability to churn through bursts of workloads faster than on-premise computing could, due to the availability of massively parallel resources.


## Introductory guides

There is a substantial amount of overlap between the needs of genomics projects and more general HPC workloads. That said, cloud platforms tend to provide gudies and dedicated services for doing genomics work in addition to their offerings for [general HPC workloads](../hpc). Here are links for the various offerings from CloudBank-supported platforms:

- AWS:
    - [AWS Genomics Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/genomics/)
- Azure:
    - [Azure Genomics Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/genomics/)
- Google Cloud Platform:
    - [Cloud Life Sciences documentation](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs)

## Case studies

- [COVID-19 Genomic Analysis](https://www.cloudbank.org/training/rroccet21-covid-19-genomic-analysis): Dr. Niema Moshiri describes the high-throughput cloud pipeline his team built to sequence the genomes of COVID-19 samples received from testing sites in California.
- [Stanford researchers accelerate autism research by sharing genomic data in the cloud](https://www.cloudbank.org/training/use-case/aws-open-data-stanford-researchers-accelerate-autism-research-sharing-genomic-data-cloud): By running sequencing jobs in parallel, a team at Stanford was able to conduct a linkage study in almost a quarter of the time it would have taken on-premise resources.
