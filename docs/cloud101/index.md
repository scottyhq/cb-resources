# Overview

Our Cloud 101 video series is a conceptual introduction to the cloud from a researcher's perspective. The series is split into six parts, reflecting at a coarse grain the topics that we keep in mind when using the cloud for a project.

These videos cover concrete examples, but stay at a relatively high level to keep at an informative pace. For more detailed walkthroughs of technical content, see our [Cloudbank Solutions](../solutions/index.md).
